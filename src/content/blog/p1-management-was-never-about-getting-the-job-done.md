**But it is about getting a job to go on a right direction**

Managing a project is like you are a captain of a ship going from A to B. To get to B, there are many paths you can choose. Some of them are fast, but full of monsters; some are slower but you don't have to worry about anything. A good captain, is not a captain that choose the fastest path and put a danger on his crewmate who might not even know how to fight, but instead, choose the most suitable path for his crew. By choosing a suitable path, it means, he is choosing the right direction to go. When thing goes right, nothing can stop you to achive your goal.

Many managers I know think the opposite. If you get to the destination, it means you go on a right direction! They obsessed with getting a task closed, finishing a project, closing a milestone, releasing new features. They applied every management methedologies just to get thing done but don't even think if it suit the team or not. In the end, things get done, but the price they must pay is their team's health. People were exhausted, burn-out or even worst, they quit! Their teammate can still work with them, but do you think they will work efficiently like before?

There can even be an occasion when you follow on the right direction but you couldn't get to your destination. This is very normal. In this situation, you must believe in yourself like a captain know his ship. When you lead the team on the correct direction, you don't cost your team's health. When people are healthy, it's very easy to fix thing, to travel again together effeciently!

Once you get the idea of managing, you may wonder the next big question: "How can I know I am going on a right direction?". This question is what make me understand how hard a manager is. To know you are going on a right direction, you must define what is "right" for your team. Defining such thing is not a simple task. It requires your knowledge about your team members, about the project, about the expectation, deadline, etc. which cannot easily get and understand in one or two days. Also, these knowledge evolves everyday, which you must update
