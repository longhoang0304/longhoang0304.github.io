Let's first define what are T-sharped, M-shaped, π-shaped skill? In the basic definition, shaped skill formed from 2 basic sharps: dash (-) and letter I.

For the dash sharp, it tells that a person knows a lots but doesn't have any specialities. About the I-shaped, it tells that a person only focus on a single topic without knowing another.

So as may you can guest, the T-shaped person is a person who know enough general knowledge and focus on a specific skill. Then π-shaped tells that person has developed more specialities skills and ultimately, you will evolved into M-shaped person.

But these things are bullshit and I think people should not use it to define career path or define their employees at all. Here is why.

The first flaw in the shaped-skill model is learning a subject will not help another. It's not true. If I learn more about how does a CPU work, I can optimize my code much better. Does learning CPU relate to coding skill? I don't think so! But does it help? Absolutely!

>  Err but these are in the same field, computer science, so you are basically going deep into computer science.

Well then did you have a hard time reading document? Sometime you wish the document to be more clear and concise. That's a sign of bad writing, and speaking of bad writing you can improve it by learning literature. So by learning literate, you can document your code better and believe it or not, will help you better at programming also. This weird combination in fact invented and studied by legendary computer scientist, Donald Knuth. You can learn more about it here: [Literate programming, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) and [Why Literate Programming Might Help You Write Better Code, TheNewStack](https://thenewstack.io/why-literate-programming-might-help-you-write-better-code/).

Secondly, they think that when you master a skill, you don't need another skills to support or only basic/generalized knowledge is enough. Maybe they forgot about applied mathematicans, physicist or in SWE world, SRE/Devops. The advanced knowledge you've learn, is built from multiple simple building blocks. THerefore, you can't just say I will learn A without learning B. It likes saying you will become a Devops without learning Network. The more you learn about the network, the system ops, the programming, the better Devops person you are. Can an applied mathematicans apply their models into finance without learning about finance or vice versa? I don't think so.

And finally, how to be called specialized? If I learn math and hardware to support my software skill. Will I become a generalist now? Or will I still be a specialist? But if I am being defined as specialist, how can this model help me to visualize the advanced knowledge that I've learnt and support my SWE career? In short, there is no clear definition for being specialized or generalized in the beginning. And as I always being told, if something isn't clear, then don't use it.

Final note, to visualize a person skill correctly, I believe we should use curves or hill-model. Like this

  *Suggestion of the visualized person's skill*
</div>

As we can see from the chart, it shows that how much a skill helps another one, how many skill this person have and how deep they know a topic. So if you want to looking for a specialized person? Look for a bell-curve. A generalist with deep knowledge? Looking for a wave curve.

<div class="post-p-image">

  *Bell curve will show a person has a specialized skill*
</div>

<div class="post-p-image">
  <img src="/blog-assets/p4/p4-wave-curve.jpg" width=320>

  *Wave curve will show a person has a general skills. More waves mean more skills*
</div>

And that's all for the today's rant. Do you agree? What's your comment? Don't be shy and drop me a Issue on github to talk about it! I want to hear from all of you!

Cheers!
